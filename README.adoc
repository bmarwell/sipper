:toc: macro

A SIP (Session Initiation Protocol for soft phones) library for Java 21+ which doesn't suck (pun intended).

toc::[]

== Development status

Started, no releases.

== API stability

None yet, goal is to have good stability before 0.4.0.

== Implementation details

This library will make use of the Java 6+ Service Loader mechanisms.
As a developer, you can code against the API only and have only the API in your class path whilst compiling.
But for the runtime, the implementation will be needed as well.
